## Features

- **Flat-Pack Postage:** They arrive flat packed for convenience.

## Sections

1. **Header:** Contains site navigation and a beautiful presentation of the POTR Pots product.

3. **Main Content:** Includes sections about the pot, its features, the team behind it, materials used, size recommendations, and a checkout section.

## IntersectionObserver Module

- Uses the IntersectionObserver API to implement scroll-triggered animations.
- Elements with the class `animate-on-scroll` will animate when they enter the viewport.
- The `rootMargin` option in the observer ensures the animations trigger a bit before the element is fully in view.

## Additional Info

- **Styles:** Styled using SCSS (referenced as `main.scss`).
- **Scripts:** The site uses custom scripts (`main.js` and `dynamicAdapt.js`).
